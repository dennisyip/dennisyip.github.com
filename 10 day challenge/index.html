	<h2>Summary</h2>

	<p>Dennis Yip <i>is a designer and aspiring software engineer</i></p>

<p>I was born on Christmas morning in the year 1988, in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Newton, a suburb approximately seven miles west of downtown Boston.  I was raised in a traditional Chinese family and learned to speak Cantonese fluently as my native tongue.</p> 

<p>At a early age I was fortunate to discover my passion for art and design. I was talented in free hand drawing, painting, and model building.  In high school,  I enrolled in graphic design and art classes to improve my creative skills.</p>  

<p>I attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, graduating with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Architecture and a minor in Chinese Language with academic honors. During college, I had the opportunity to travel around the world and experience many new cultures that changed my life. I concentrated my studies in green building and sustainabilty. During my junior year, I studied abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark, one of the world's leading cities for green growth.  While I was there I learned about the solutions around tackling challenges in building consumption of waste, energy and heating. Studying abroad opened my mind and pushed me to effetively communicate my ideas. Through college I developed strong skills in Adobe Photoshop, Indesign, and Illustrator from designing presentational boards for projects. </p>    


<p>After graduation I worked as a laboratory animal technician at Tufts University School of Medicine for two years.  My job included duties as both a technician and supervisor to a facility housing up to forty thousand animals for biomedical research.  While working at Tufts, I learned many valuable lessons about communication and team work.</p> 

<p>I currently applied to Boston Startup Institute's Front End Ramp Up program.  In the program, I hope to develop my skills building web pages, learning proper spacing, interaction design, and visual design.  Eventually, I hope to make a career change and find a job at a local startup where I can utilize my design skills.</p>

<p>When I am not in front my computer, I spend most of my time outdoors. I am a passionate rock climber. I spent weekends with friends finding new climbing spots and challenging boulder routes.  Currently, I have also developed a interest in long distance running. This summer I have been running between 15-20 miles a week. I hope to run a half marathon within the next year.</p>
