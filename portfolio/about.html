			<p>I was born on Christmas morning, in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Newton, a suburb approximately seven miles west Boston. I was raised in a traditional Chinese family and learned to speak Cantonese fluently as my native tongue.</p> 

			<p>At a early age I was fortunate to discover my passion for art and design. I was talented in free hand drawing, painting, and model building.  In high school,  I enrolled in graphic design and art classes to improve my creative skills.</p>
